1) The bug was missing semi-colons in the calculateSum function and that it takes the input as strings and performs a concatenation instead of an addition operation.
2) I fixed it by including 'Number' infront of both num1 and num2 to make sure an addition is done and not concatenation and adding semi-colons.
