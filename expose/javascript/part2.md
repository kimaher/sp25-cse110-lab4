13) 
    1)  '32' since integers map to their exact string representation.
    2)  1 because the '-' operator only makes sence in arithmetics.
    3)  3 because null is mapped to 0 arithmetically
    4)  '3null' because since '3' is a string null is treated as a string to concatenate.
    5)  4 because true maps to 1
    6)  0 because both map to 0 and 0+0 = 0
    7)  '3undefined' because when one is a string then the + operator performs a concatenation
    8)  NaN because - forces both arguements to be converted to a number and undefiend is not a number so the result is not a number.
14) 
    1)  true because '2' maps to a number
    2)  false because both are treated as string and compared lexicographically
    3)  true because '2' maps to 2
    4)  false because === operator checks for strict equality no type coersion
    5)  false because true maps to 1
    6)  true because Boolean(2) is equal to true
15) The == operator allows for type coersion before checking equality and the === operator does not.

17) The result is [2,4,6] because for each value in the given array, the doSomething function gets called back and returns a value 2 times the original. Then the new array is all the values in the original multiplied by 2.
